# Bluetooth Driver for Sensirion SHT4x Smart Gadget
This repository contains a bluetooth driver and a GUI for the [SHT4x Smart Gadget](https://www.sensirion.com/de/produkte/katalog/SHT4x-Smart-Gadget/) by Sensirion. In order to run the code, install the requirements.txt and run SHT_driver.py. The script will output a list of the UUID addresses of all nearby bluetooth devices. If you activated bluetooth on your Smart Gadget, the list should output something like "2511E127-7CAB-66A8-915B-653A5D55A843: SHT40 Gadget". Copy the UUID address of your device and paste it into the UUID_SHT variable in the SHT_GUI.py file. Afterwards, you should be able to run SHT_GUI.py to see the temperature, relative humidity and dew point of the environment as measured by the Smart Gadget dispayed in real time.
